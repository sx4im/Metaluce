Project Concept: Build a hackathon-ready web application called AI Meeting Context Summarizer + Action Mapper. The goal of this application is to take a meeting transcript (either pasted text or uploaded file) and automatically generate:

Key decisions made in the meeting

Action items assigned to participants

Priority levels (high, medium, low) for each action item
The AI analysis should be powered by IBM’s AI API (or a mock response for development), but the primary focus is on creating a polished, interactive, frontend-first user interface that judges will find clear, intuitive, and professional.

Project Requirements and Goals:

Frontend should be built using React + Tailwind CSS, fully responsive, clean, and modern.

Include a landing page where users can paste text or upload a .txt file.

Display AI results in cards with sections for Summary, Action Items, and optionally a Kanban-style visualization sorted by priority.

Use Loading spinners, error handling, and visual polish (shadows, colors, hover effects) to make it feel like a real SaaS product.

Mock AI responses are allowed for early development; later integration with IBM API should be straightforward.

Deployment should be possible on Vercel or Netlify, with preloaded sample transcripts for demo purposes.

User Experience Goals:

The workflow should be one-click simple: paste/upload → Analyze → see results.

Demonstration should be fast (under 60 seconds) and fully functional, giving judges an instant understanding of the tool’s value.

Focus on clarity, interactivity, and usability over complex AI logic.

Output Expectations:

A fully structured React project with proper folder structure (/components, /pages, /utils, /api).

Reusable components for UploadArea, ResultCard, LoadingSpinner, and optional KanbanBoard.

Backend API endpoint (/api/aiCall) that accepts transcripts and returns AI JSON output.

Polished, production-ready frontend with responsive design and clear UX.

Demo-ready deployment configuration with preloaded samples.

Overall Goal for Cursor AI: Generate a complete, hackathon-ready project skeleton that allows a solo frontend developer to build, demo, and submit this AI-powered tool successfully, with the AI integration being simple to replace later.
